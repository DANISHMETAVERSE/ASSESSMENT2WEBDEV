            <h2 class="hidden">League of Legends V1.0.0.109</h2>
            <h3 class="hidden">Champions</h3>
            <h4 class="hidden">Renekton, the Butcher of the Sands</h4>
            <p class="hidden">Renekton uses a new resource system called Fury. Renekton gains Fury by attacking or dealing damage with spells. When he has gathered enough Fury, the resource will be expended to empower his skills with bonus effects.</p>
            <ul class="hidden">
                <li><strong>Reign of Anger (Innate):</strong> Renekton gains 5 Fury per autoattack. Having sufficient fury empowers Renekton’s abilities with bonus effects, but this drains Fury. Out of combat, Renekton loses 5 Fury per second.</li>
                <li><strong>Cull the Meek:</strong> Renekton swings his blade, dealing damage to nearby enemies and healing for a portion of the damage dealt.
                    <br><em>Fury Bonus:</em> Heal amount raised dramatically.</li>
                <li><strong>Ruthless Predator:</strong> Renekton's next attack swings twice, dealing damage, plus a large portion of his base damage, stunning his target briefly and applying on-hit effects each time.
                    <br><em>Fury Bonus:</em> Renekton's next attack swings three times, dealing a huge portion of his weapon damage, stunning his target greatly and applying on-hits each time.</li>
                <li><strong>Slice:</strong> Renekton dashes forward, dealing physical damage to targets along the way. If he hits a target, he can use Dice for a brief period of time for the same effect.
                    <br><em>Fury Bonus:</em> Renekton deals 50% increased damage and reduces the armor of units hit.</li>
                <li><strong>Dominus (Ultimate):</strong> Renekton empowers himself with dark energy, gaining size and bonus health. He deals periodic damage to enemies around him and rapidly gains Fury.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="hidden">Caitlyn</h4>
            <ul class="hidden">
                <li><strong>Piltover Peacemaker:</strong> Base damage changed to 20 / 65 / 110 / 155 / 200 from 40 / 70 / 100 / 130 / 160. Attack damage scaling increased to 1.3 from 1. Damage loss per unit increased to 10% from 6%. Maximum damage loss increased to 50% from 30%.</li>
                <li><strong>Ace in the Hole:</strong> Base damage increased to 250 / 475 / 700 from 250 / 400 / 550. Now provides vision on the target for the duration and thus is not canceled when the target leaves line of sight. Damage is now treated as a spell instead of an attack. No longer triggers on-hit effects like Blessing of the Lizard Elder. Now triggers spell effects like Rylai's Crystal Scepter. Cannot be dodged or blocked by Pantheon's Aegis Protection. Fixed a bug where it didn't scale from the Havoc mastery.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="hidden">Cho'Gath</h4>
            <ul class="hidden">
                <li><strong>Feast:</strong> Now loses half stacks (rounded up) instead of 3 stacks on death. This is inconsistent with the last known change during V1.0.0.86.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="hidden">Items</h4>
            <ul class="hidden">
                <li><strong>Chain Vest:</strong> Now shows the 6 items it builds into instead of 5.</li>
                <li><strong>Long Sword:</strong> Upgrade paths updated.</li>
                <li><strong>Wards:</strong> No longer grant experience on death.</li>
                <li><strong>Vision Ward:</strong> Cost reduced to 125 from 150.</li>
                <li><strong>Rabadon's Deathcap:</strong> Total cost increased to 3400 from 3300.</li>
                <li><strong>The Black Cleaver:</strong> Fixed a bug where it didn't appear in the Attack Speed tab.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="hidden">Masteries</h4>
            <ul class="hidden">
                <li><strong>Ardor:</strong> Now provides all of its benefit at level 1 rather than half at level 1 and the other half scaling up to level 18. Fixed bugs where Ardor was not counting Ability Power and Attack Speed from many sources - essentially anything that wasn't an item. Fixed a bug where Ardor and Rabadon's Deathcap were double multiplicative. Clarified the tooltip.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="hidden">General</h4>
            <ul class="hidden">
                <li>We have changed how critical strike and dodge chance work. You will now get fewer ‘lucky’ or ‘unlucky’ streaks where you get no critical hits/dodges in a row, or a lot of them in a row. Your average chance to get a crit is the same as before though – if you have a 50% crit rate, and you make 100 attacks, you’ll still crit about 50 times.</li>
                <li>Baron Nashor's Wrath of the Ancients spell no longer targets stealthed units.</li>
                <li>Jungle monsters that previously had negative magic resistance now have magic resistance of zero.</li>
                <li>Monster camps will now properly update when scouted with vision.</li>
                <li>Chat will now display the Champion being played by the person who is speaking.</li>
            </ul>
